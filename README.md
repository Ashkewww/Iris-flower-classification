# Iris Flower Classification with Machine Learning

This repository contains a Python script for classifying the famous Iris flower dataset using machine learning techniques. 
The dataset is visualized using Matplotlib and Seaborn, and three different classifiers (K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression) are used to predict the species of the iris flowers.

About the Project
The Iris flower dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning and pattern recognition. It contains measurements of four features of three different species of iris flowers: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to load and preprocess the dataset, visualize the data using scatter plots, and perform classification using various machine learning algorithms.

The classifiers used in this project are:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A non-parametric classification algorithm that assigns a class label based on the majority class among its k-nearest neighbors in the feature space.

Decision Tree: A tree-like model where each node represents a feature and each leaf node represents a class label. It makes decisions based on the values of features.

Logistic Regression: Despite its name, logistic regression is used for binary and multi-class classification problems. It models the probability that a given input point belongs to a particular class.
